Hack To-Do List:
* Ensure proper clearing of Speed Shoes. We only want fast boss music in Pinch mode
* Fix bug with executing Peelout at the right edge of the screen (similar to the spindash bug)
	Noticable in bosses.
* Add underwater and cycling palettes for Easy/Hard Mode
* Fix minor palette errors (Buzz Bomber Missile, SLZ Boss spikeball)
* Finish Easy Mode layouts. Need feedback from others.
* Give Drop Dash proper physics
